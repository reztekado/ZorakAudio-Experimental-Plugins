# 3DPanner

## What it is
3DPanner is a **headphone-focused, mouse-first perceptual 3D panner**.

The current build is **Hyperreal 3D Panner V6.5 — UI-Only Perceptual Position + Side Drawer Manager IPC**. It is built around direct object placement instead of raw degree dialing, with optional subscription to **3DPannerManager** for shared camera rotation.

The source combines several perceptual cues:

- softened lateral / front-rear placement
- Spatial Throw for directional cue intensity
- microdelay / interaural timing
- head-shadow style darkening
- pinna-style outside-head cues
- distance loss and air absorption
- occlusion filtering
- room and early-bounce cues
- micro motion for static-source stability
- Automation Safe smoothing
- DSP-JSFX `gmem` / `msg_*` manager-link communication
- a canvas-based UI for direct placement and visual feedback

It is not just a left/right pan with a width knob. It separates **where the object appears visually** from **how hard the spatial cue stack fires**.

## Manager link / scene camera workflow

V6.5 keeps standalone use clean. The native sliders are hidden and used only as the saved/automation backend. Manager / IPC setup is opt-in and lives in the **Scene Link side drawer**, opened from the small `SCN LNK` tab.

### Scene Bus
Shared DSP-JSFX bus namespace. This must match the **3DPannerManager** Scene Bus.

### Object Name
Human-readable object name for the communication layer / peer registry. Routing still uses numeric instance IDs and Object IDs.

### Object ID
Stable scene object ID. Give each mapped object a unique ID unless you intentionally want several sound layers to represent the same object.

### Target Manager ID
Manager channel to follow on the Scene Bus. This lets several 3DPannerManager instances coexist without every panner following the same one.

### Manager Link
Disabled by default. When enabled from the side drawer, this panner follows the shared manager camera rotation. The panner's local placement becomes its fixed world/object position.

### Manager Amount
Amount of the manager camera transform applied to this object. 100% is normal scene behavior. 0% behaves like standalone while still keeping the manager section configured.

Basic scene setup:

```text
1. Add one 3DPannerManager.
2. Set Manager Scene Bus.
3. Add 3DPanner instances.
4. Give each panner the same Scene Bus.
5. Assign Object IDs and Object Names.
6. Set Target Manager ID to the manager channel you want, then enable Manager Link.
7. Place each object once.
8. Automate Manager Camera Rotation.
```

Communication uses the repository DSP-JSFX runtime API: `comm_join`, `instance_set_name`, `msg_subscribe`, `msg_advertise`, `msg_send`, `msg_recv`, `gmem_attach_size`, and shared `gmem[]`. Scene Bus and Object Name are edited through custom GFX text boxes; Enter commits, Escape cancels, and Backspace/Delete remove characters.

## Why use it
Use it when a sound should feel like it sits in a headphone space instead of merely moving across the stereo field.

3DPanner is meant for fast placement, animation, and automation-friendly movement. You grab the source, place it, then decide how strongly it should assert that position.

---

## Quick start
1. Insert 3DPanner on the sound you want to place.
2. Drag the orange source in the stage canvas.
   - X = **Lateral**
   - Y = **Depth Front/Rear**
3. Use the mouse wheel over the canvas to adjust **Distance**.
4. Adjust **Spatial Throw** if the position feels too subtle or too extreme.
5. Use **Size**, **Push Out**, **Room**, **Occlusion**, and **Micro Motion** to shape the object.
6. Leave **Automation Safe** on for drawn automation and fast movement.
7. Trim the result with **Output Trim**.

## Main controls

### Lateral
Left/right object placement.

Negative values place the object left. Positive values place it right.

### Depth Front/Rear
Front/back object placement.

Positive values place the object toward the front wall. Negative values place it toward the rear wall.

### Distance
How close or far the source feels.

V6 uses a tighter, higher-resolution distance range than the older raw-distance model, so small movements are easier to dial in.

### Spatial Throw
Spatial cue intensity.

This controls how strongly the placement asserts itself through ITD, head shadow, pinna cues, and lateral weighting. It does **not** directly change output gain.

Use this when the source is visually in the right place but sounds too narrow or too exaggerated.

### Size
Apparent source size.

Low values make a tight point source. High values make the source wider and more diffuse.

### Push Out
Outside-head realism.

This is the renamed and more intuitive version of Externalize. It strengthens cues that help the source feel less trapped inside the head.

### Room
Amount of early reflection / room cue contribution.

Higher values make the space more audible and externalized, but less surgically dry.

### Occlusion
How blocked, hidden, or screened the source feels.

Higher values darken and smear the direct path while letting room/reflection energy become more dominant.

### Micro Motion
Tiny movement added to reduce headphone collapse on static sources.

Use low values for subtle life. Use higher values when the source should feel more animated.

### Output Trim
Final gain trim after spatial processing.

## Automation / advanced controls

### Automation Safe
Caps aggressive spatial behavior and uses safer smoothing for automation curves.

Leave this enabled for most automation. Disable it only when you deliberately want sharper, more extreme movement.

### Cue Curve
Controls how much moderate visual angles are perceptually softened.

Higher values make mid-angle placements less extreme while still allowing strong side placement when needed.

### Motion Smooth
Movement smoothing time in milliseconds.

Higher values make automation smoother and less jumpy. Lower values make movement more immediate.

### Room Size
Scale of the room-cue geometry.

Higher values make the virtual room larger and increase early reflection timing.

---

## Visual cues

The UI is part of the workflow. The canvas is not decorative; it shows what each spatial control is doing.

### Orange source
The solid orange orb is the visual object position.

### Ghost source
The ghost orange orb is the effective cue position after Spatial Throw and Cue Curve compression.

This makes the plugin honest: the object can be visually placed at 45° left while the actual cue intensity is softened for a more natural result.

### Size cue
Size is shown with an orange halo / cloud around the source.

Bigger halo means a larger or more diffuse source. It does not mean farther away.

### Distance cue
Distance is shown with range rings and distance dashes from the listener.

Farther positions show more range separation without turning the source into a width effect.

### Push Out cue
Push Out is shown with a listener-centered shell.

A stronger shell means the sound is being pushed farther outside the head. It does not mean the object itself moved farther away.

### Room cue
Room is shown with cyan wall bounces, wall-hit markers, and room glow.

The cyan wall markers represent early bounce cues that help the sound externalize.

### Motion cue
Motion is shown with a green dotted trail around the source.

More motion produces a stronger trail.

## Mouse controls

### Canvas
- Drag source = set Lateral + Depth Front/Rear
- Mouse wheel = Distance
- Shift-drag = fine placement
- Ctrl/Cmd-drag = lateral-only movement
- Alt/Option-drag = distance-only movement
- Ctrl/Cmd + wheel = Spatial Throw
- Alt/Option + wheel = Push Out
- Right-click canvas = reset position

### Control lanes
- Drag lane = set value
- Shift-drag lane = fine edit
- Mouse wheel over lane = quick edit
- Right-click lane = reset that control

### Snap chips
Use the snap chips for fast common placements:

- Center
- 30L
- 45L
- 60L
- 30R
- 45R
- 60R
- Rear

These set the visual object placement. Spatial Throw still controls how aggressively that placement is rendered.

---

## Notes
The current UI is designed around object placement, not degree management.

Older versions exposed raw **Azimuth** and **Externalize** as primary controls. V6 replaces that workflow with **Lateral**, **Depth Front/Rear**, **Distance**, **Spatial Throw**, and **Push Out**.

This is an intentional compatibility break. Presets from older versions should be rebuilt by ear instead of copied blindly.

---

## In one sentence
3DPanner places a headphone source as an object in a perceptual room, then lets you control how strongly that placement, distance, size, room, and outside-head cues are expressed.


## UI-only notes

V6.5 hides native sliders with JSFX hidden-parameter labels plus `slider_show()`. The GFX UI writes the same slider variables, so preset recall, project state, and automation-backed numeric values still work.

Visible GFX-only controls now include:

```text
Scene Link side drawer
Scene Bus text box
Object Name text box
Object ID stepper
Manager Link toggle
Manager Amount mini-slider
Automation Safe toggle
Main quick-control lanes
Advanced Cue Curve / Smooth / Room Size lanes
```

Text input is intentionally simple ASCII for stable bus and instance names.
